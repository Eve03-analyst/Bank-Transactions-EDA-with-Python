**Key Insights from Transaction Analysis**
•	13.3M total transactions analyzed across 74,831 merchants and 12,492 cities—a highly diverse payment network.
•	Swipe transactions dominate (52%), indicating reliance on older card technology and higher inherent fraud risk relative to chip/online.
•	E-commerce is significant, with ONLINE listed as the most common “city,” reflecting strong digital transaction volume.
•	California leads transaction activity, representing the single largest geographic share of payments.
•	Grocery stores (MCC 5411) are the top merchant category, showing that routine consumer spending drives volume.
•	Error rate is low (1.58%), and most failures are due to insufficient balance, not system faults or fraud.
•	Seasonal and time-of-day spikes exist—December 25th and early afternoon hours show the highest transaction counts.
•	Average transaction amount: $42.98.
•	Transaction variability: High standard deviation ($81.66) indicates wide spread in amounts.
•	Minimum transaction: -$500 (likely refunds or chargebacks).
•	Lower quartile (25%): $8.93 – 25% of transactions are below $9.
•	Median (50%): $28.99 – half of transactions are below $29.
•	Upper quartile (75%): $63.71 – 25% of transactions exceed $63.71.
•	Maximum transaction: $6,820.20 – extreme high-value transactions exist, likely outliers.
•	Distribution insight: Skewed right, with a few very high-value transactions pulling the mean above the median.
**Analysis of merchant hotspots based on transaction counts**
•	Top merchant by volume: 59935 with 610,053 transactions – clearly the busiest merchant.
•	Other high-activity merchants:
o	27092 → 589,140
o	61195 → 562,410
o	39021 → 440,281
o	43293 → 362,842
•	Moderate hotspots:
o	22204 → 347,511
o	14528 → 333,505
o	60569 → 301,657
o	50783 → 298,231
o	75781 → 273,351
•	Insight: A small set of merchants dominates transaction volume, indicating concentration of activity. These are the key hotspots to monitor for operational load, potential fraud, or marketing opportunities.
Payment method usage based on your data
•	Swipe Transactions: 6,967,185 → ~52% of total transactions – most common method.
•	Chip Transactions: 4,780,818 → ~36% – significant adoption but less than swipe.
•	Online Transactions: 1,557,912 → ~12% – least frequent, reflecting lower e-commerce share in this dataset.
•	Insight: Traditional swipe still dominates, but chip usage shows substantial penetration. Online transactions are minor, suggesting either early adoption phase or a focus on in-person payments.
**Analysis of transaction errors from your dataset**
•	Top single errors:
o	Insufficient Balance: 12,160 → most frequent issue, likely reflecting customer account limits.
o	Bad Card Number: 7,766 → indicates card entry errors or invalid cards.
o	Bad Expiration: 6,161 → expired or incorrectly entered card dates.
o	Bad CVV: 6,103 → security code entry errors.
o	Technical Glitch: 3,024 → system-related failures, smaller but notable.
•	Combined errors (rare):
o	Examples: Bad Card Number + Insufficient Balance (70), Bad CVV + Insufficient Balance (57) → very low frequency but indicate multiple failure points per transaction.
•	Insight:
o	Majority of errors are user-input related rather than system failures.
o	Insufficient Balance dominates, suggesting possible patterns in failed transactions tied to specific cardholders or merchants.
o	Combined errors are negligible but could be targeted for troubleshooting high-value or recurring customers.
